# CLI Tool

This is a basic CLI tool built using Node.js, and some third-party npm packages such as `chalk`, `arg`, `ajv`, etc. Additionally, a custom logger has been created for handling warnings.

## Features

- **Custom Logger**: Handles warnings and logs them effectively.
- **AJV Integration**: A JSON schema validator to ensure that the data adheres to an expected format. The tool compiles schemas to optimized JSON validators.

### Example Usage of AJV:

```js
import Ajv from 'ajv';

const ajv = new Ajv();
const schema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    name: { type: 'string' },
    age: { type: 'integer' }
  },
  required: ['name']
};

const data = {
  name: 'Ehsaan',
  age: 22,
};

const valid = ajv.validate(schema, data); // returns boolean: true || false
console.log(valid);
```
